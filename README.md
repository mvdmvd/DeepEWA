# DeepEWA

The aim of this project is to train a NN to predict the convergence characteristics of learning dynamics on 2x2 games.

ProbsEWA.jl contains the algorithm that classifies the convergence of a specific combination of learning dynamics and game.

DeepEWA.ipynb is a notebook that trains a NN to predict convergence classes.

This project is based on Pangallo et al. (2021).
